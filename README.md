# GBA1 Shiny App



## Welcome to the GBA1 portal!

An interactive website for clinicians and researchers dedicated to comprehending GBA1-related disorders.

## What is GBA1 gene?

This particular gene codes for a protein found in the lysosomal membrane. Its function involves breaking the beta-glucosidic bond in glycosylceramide, an intermediate compound in the process of glycolipid metabolism. Defects in this gene lead to Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder marked by the buildup of glucocerebrosides. There is a similar non-functional version of this gene, called a pseudogene, located about 12 kb downstream on chromosome 1. Through alternative splicing, various forms of the gene's transcripts are produced. This information was provided by RefSeq in January 2010.(https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GBA1)

Variations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) are prevalent genetic factors contributing to the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). GBA is responsible for producing an enzyme found in lysosomes, which breaks down glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine into glucose residue and ceramide/sphingosine, respectively. Several pieces of evidence now connect decreased glucocerebrosidase activity to PD, even in individuals without GBA variations. This reduced enzyme activity is associated with an increase in the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Additionally, numerous independent postmortem studies have indicated lower glucocerebrosidase activity in the brains of sporadic PD cases compared to control brains. Carrying GBA variations might impact the presentation of PD. PD patients who carry GBA variations experience an earlier onset of symptoms and a faster progression of both motor and cognitive symptoms compared to PD patients without these variations.


## What is GBA1 portal?

Currently, clinical, genetic, and molecular data about the GBA1 gene are not connected and distributed across registries, databases, and the literature.In order to address these existing constraints, we have created the GBA1-Portal. This portal comprises the most extensive collection of expert-curated data, alongside user-friendly analytical tools and educational materials, all aimed at surmounting the current limitations. 

## Methods

Presently, we aggregated pathogenic variants in GBA1 published and unpublished clinical and genetic data. We collected and curated β-Glucocerebrosidase activity data in GBA1 linked Parkinsonin disease from the literature. These data were connected with protein structures, and annotated with the location of each variants and interactions of the variants within 3D protein structures.



## Results

The GBA1-Portal has been meticulously crafted to cater to specific user scenarios:

i) Education: We offer a comprehensive repository of information concerning GBA1-associated conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Gaucher disease (GD).

ii) Expert-level variant interpretation: Our platform includes meticulously curated web applications that empower users to classify variant pathogenicity at an expert level.

iii) Research utility: Embedded within the GBA1-Portal is a potent research tool that facilitates in-depth exploration of our expansive and distinctive biomedical data repository. Users will be adeptly guided through tutorials featuring illustrative examples, eliminating the need for any programming skills.

This portal presents a range of insights into GBA1 variants, encompassing details about its domains, its phenotype in PD and GD, and the β-Glucocerebrosidase activity for select GBA1 variants.

# Conclusions: 

The GBA1-Portal infrastructure is scalable and, with increasing data, may transform variant interpretation, research and education for GBA1. The GBA1-Portal will be hosted at http://........
